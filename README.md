This project started out as an attempt to add petridish.pw modes to Ogar. Then I realised that it was really slow, so I ported my project to MultiOgar, and started optimizing it. At first, everything worked very well, with improvements up to 20% over MultiOgar. But when I started to do more optimizations, instead of speeding up, Petridish-Ogar started to slow down. Sorry, but until we get a decent JavaScript JIT compiler or I learn assembly, this project simply isn't going to be much better than other Ogar servers. I'm almost sure rewriting in assembly will be worth the time. Estimated performance with 5000 minions: 160 times faster than Petridish Ogar! Keep in mind that with vanilla settings, Petridish Ogar minions are already 160 times faster than OgarUL (on OgarUL 1 frame takes a bit over 6 seconds). So, the assembly version of Petridish Ogar is going to be 25600 times faster than OgarUL!
